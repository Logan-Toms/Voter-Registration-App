# Voter Registration Application

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script developed as part of my college coursework. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Python and my ability to validate user input and guide users through a structured process. This coursework is part of my Building Secure Python Applications (SDEV 300) class at the University of Maryland Global Campus.

## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To collect and validate user input for voter registration.
- To ensure users meet the age and citizenship requirements for voting.
- To guide users through the registration process with clear instructions and feedback.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Input Validation**: Implementing checks to ensure user input is valid and within specified constraints.
- **Control Flow**: Using control flow mechanisms to guide users through a series of steps and provide appropriate feedback.
- **User Interaction**: Creating a user-friendly interface through the command line to interact with users effectively.
- **Error Handling**: Managing incorrect inputs and providing clear error messages to users.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- **Develop Practical Skills**: Applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, enhancing my understanding of user input validation and control flow in Python.
- **Improve User Experience**: Learned to design and implement user-friendly command-line interfaces.
- **Enhance Problem-Solving Abilities**: Improved my ability to handle and respond to user errors and unexpected inputs.

## Files Included
- `sdev_wk1_lab1.py`: The main Python script for the voter registration application.

## Usage Instructions
To run the voter registration application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Logan-Toms/Voter-Registration-App.git
    cd voter-registration-app
    ```

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python sdev_wk1_lab1.py
    ```

3. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**:
    - Choose to register to vote by selecting option `1`.
    - Enter the required details (first name, last name, age, citizenship, state, and zip code).
    - The application will validate your inputs and guide you through the registration process.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to develop the application.
- **Standard Python Libraries**: Utilized for input handling and system exit functionality.
